A DTMF dial tone analyser. This is Luigi Auriemma's work based on his 0.1.1 release as found in Debian archives

I couldn't find the upstream source so have created this repository to enable me to make some changes so this builds cleanly with Yocto

The intent is to use this for hardware-in-the-loop testing of speakers and microphones on board hardware
